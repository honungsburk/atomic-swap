# TODO

A simple list of features and improvements that could be added to Atomic Swap.
You can think of this as the step before I create a task.

- Support for Ergo
- Show the image of NFTs
- Make sure the app can operate even if blockfrost is down
- Allow users to turn off fetching metadata from blockfrost
- Check that the users browser supports all the browser API:s we are using (audio & mic + webrtc)
- Update toasts to have the correct colors.
- Make app responsive when the wallet changes network etc
- After a successfully trade the website refreshes so as to get into a known state... we should fix so that we don't have to do that anymore
- Make a clear distinction in the GUI between raw data and when we use metadata
- Create a bunch of proper issues from this TODO...
- Refactor and use Text & Layer Styles (Chakra UI)
- Refactor to use Semantic Tokens (Chakra UI)
- Upgrade to React 18
- npm audit
- Move to Github
- Fix issue with "PrintColorAdjust"
